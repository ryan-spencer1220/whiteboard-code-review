Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

function selectionSort(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i+1; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (array[i] > array[j]) {
        const higherValue = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = higherValue;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}

array = [9, 2, 7, 12]
const sortedArray = array.sort((a, b) => {
  return a - b
});
